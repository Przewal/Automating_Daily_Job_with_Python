# Python - Challenge

This project is submitted as a part of the weekly assignment for the FinTech course in USyd. This repository contains two projects, PyBank and PyRamen. The details of the two files are delineated below.

## PyBank

The PyBank is a financial analysis project which returns basic summary statistics from the provided csv file __budget_data__.

The goal was to return
* Total months
* Net Total
* Average Change
* Greatest increase/decrease

The greatest increase/decrease is first initialized into a dictionary and then the max and min values are returned. 

The output is printed into a text file.

## PyRamen

The PyRamen is a sales analysis project which returns basic summary statistics by interlinking two csv files __menu_data__ & __sales_data__. The columns in sales data are matched with menu data.

The goal was to return
* The total quantity sold for each ramen type
* The total revenue for each ramen type
* The total cost of goods sold for each ramen type
* The total profit for each ramen type

The output is printed into a text file, where each ramen type and the four statistics are printed.

## Working

* The codes involve importing csv and pathlib (useful if the data is stored in a different path).
* Pseudo-code is provided in each file to understand the logical flow of things. 
* Relevant comments are added to each line of code from sense-making
